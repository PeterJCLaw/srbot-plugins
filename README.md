A collection of [rbot](http://ruby-rbot.org) plugins useful to
[Student Robotics](https://www.studentrobotics.org).

The `./test` script can be used to do some testing of the plugins,
but uses a mock framework to run them, rather than rbot.

Hint: use 'rbot: rescan' to reload the available plugins without
needing to restart your rbot instance.
