A collection of [Willie](http://willie.dftba.net/) plugins useful to
[Student Robotics](https://www.studentrobotics.org).

The plugins themselves are kept entirely within the `plugins` dir, which
avoids Willie also picking up the tests.

Tests can be run with `nosetests`.

Hint: Willie can be instructed to reload his plugins with `.reload`
